    new hires to interact with Electronic Health Record software. During this time, I have sought to improve these
    trainings by including real world scenarios and integrating documentation requirements. Re-designing these trainings
    has reduced the amount of end user support tickets submitted to the help desk by 60% compared to my predecessor. The
    graph below shows data I aggregated from the EHR software on the number of new hires I have trained in the past
    three years.
