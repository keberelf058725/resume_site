            <p class hello>Hello {{Name|safe}},</p>

            <p class="indent">I'm writing to apply for the available {{Field_Applied|safe}} position. Over the past few years, I have
                been privileged to gain significant experience in creating and managing several business intelligence reports to my employer’s requirements. The ad-hoc BI reports are
                generated from a wide variety of areas including excel and sql. The reports also cover a variety of different data categories like financial data and complaince data.
                With this experience in Data Analysis, I excel in determining where data can be leveraged to either gain insight into trends or automate repetitive tasks.
                </p>

            <p class="indent">I have also acquired proficient skills in utilizing data analytics and Business Intelligence software to solve
                issues with departmental workflows. One of these projects that I
                have created to solve these issues is a report that generates a list of randomly selected patients for Urine Drug
                Screens,where each patient appears only once per week and never on the same day as the prior week. Another
                report that I created, tracks patient medical appointments to ensure patients are seen each week in accordance to
                insurance requirements. I am confident that my skills are well-aligned with this role, and that I would
                be an excellent fit for your organization.</p>

            <p class="indent">I have experience with working in a team setting, as well as working on my own with minor supervision. My
                goal in applying for this position is to continue my career by learning and
                growing my knowledge base. I believe my experiences and track record make me an excellent addition to your
                company’s team. I have enclosed my resume for your consideration.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Kevin H. Caldon Jr.</p>
