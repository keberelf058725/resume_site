        <h4 style="text-align: center">About Me</h4>
        I am a very hard worker and a quick learner which<br> makes for the perfect storm of talent and skills!<br>
        But lets put that aside for a second since what would<br> life be with constant work and no play?<br>
        When I am not working you can usually find me on a disc<br> golf course, this is one of my favorite past times!<br>
        So much so that I volunteered to spend some of<br> my free time as the Treasure for the 2022-2023 <a href="https://palmbeachdiscgolf.com/" target="_blank">Palm Beach Disc Golf</a>
        Club Board of Directors.<br>
        Along with disc golf I also enjoy playing video games,<br> snorkeling at the beach, and learning as much as I can
        about programing.<br>
