        I began working in this IT as strictly a software analyst training end users on how to operate an EHR. This role also required that I
        provide basic end user support through a helpdesk and basic excel ad-hoc analytics. From this position I began teaching myself how to use platforms such as Microsoft Power BI and Power Automate
        to automate and improve my ad-hoc analytics. Once I was able to automate all of my reporting it
        allowed me to analyze other department's workflows to see where reporting could streamline those workflows or where data could be leveraged to solve ongoing issues. I have since moved on and began teaching myself Python primarily to use for analytics, but I can also use it to create cool projects such as this site. I am also
        in the middle of teaching myself SQL by building my own SQL server (using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>) and applying that to a similar Django web App that will host analytics and excel analysis tools for end users to consume.
        I am a very quick learner which makes for the perfect storm of talent and skills!
        But let's put that aside for a second since what would life be with constant work and no play?
        When I am not working you can usually find me on a disc golf course, this is one of my favorite past times!
        So much so that I volunteered to spend some of my free time as the Treasure for the 2022-2023 <a href="https://palmbeachdiscgolf.com/" target="_blank">Palm Beach Disc Golf</a>
        Club Board of Directors.
        Along with disc golf I also enjoy playing video games, snorkeling at the beach, and learning as much as I can
        about programing.
