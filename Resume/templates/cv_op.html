            <p class="indent">I'm writing to apply for the available {{Field_Applied|safe}} position. Over the Past few months I have been teaching my self
            how to code using python. As you can see from this website, which uses DJango, it is going pretty well! This is partly due to the fact that I am a very fast learner! I have also created a bunch of Data Sience scripts
            using Jupyter Notebook and the pandas library. Most of the work I have done has been for the most part pretty basic, but again, I am a very fast learner.</p>

            <p class="indent">Some of the other projects I have worked on using python was to create a GUI using Tkinter to solve a workflow issue with a user's lack of knowledge with excel. This GUI
            uses tkinter to provide an interface for the user to upload an excel sheet and pandas to genterate a count of rows, the min date out of all the date values, and the max date out of all the date values. This then returns the
            values in a formatted string to the end user to copy into their report. I am also currently in the process of creating a custom data analytics web site to be hosted on a local network. This site will host a repository of
            pdf reports generated by my Power Bi Pagenated Reports (SSRS). It is also being designed to allows users that do not have experience with excel run custom scripts on an
            excel sheet and return the relevant data based on what the script is meant to accomplish.</p>

            <p class="indent">I have experience with working in a team setting, as well as working on my own with minor supervision. My
                goal in applying for this position is to continue my career as a software analyst by learning and growing my
                knowledge base. I believe my experiences and track record make me an excellent addition to your companyâ€™s team. I have
                enclosed my resume for your consideration.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Kevin H. Caldon Jr.</p>
